[Intro]
Whoo!
Oh yeah!

[Radio: Ingame Only]
Attention all units. Suspect seen heading south
Block all major roads and capture the suspect

[Verse 1]
Rollin' around at the speed of sound
Got places to go, gotta follow my rainbow
Can't stick around, have to keep movin' on
Guess what lies ahead, only one way to find out!
Must keep on movin' ahead
No time for guessin', follow my plan instead
Trustin' in what you can't see
Take my lead, I'll set you free

[Chorus]
Follow me, set me free
Trust me and we will escape from the city
I'll make it through, follow me
Follow me, set me free
Trust me and we will escape from the city
I'll make it through; prove it to you
Follow me!
Oh yeah!

[Verse 2]
Danger is lurking around every turn
Trust your feelings, got to live and learn
I know with some luck that I'll make it through
Got no more other options, only one thing to do!
I don't care what lies ahead
No time for guessin', follow my plan instead
Find that next stage, no matter what that may be
Take my lead, I'll set you free

[Chorus']
Follow me, set me free
Trust me and we will escape from the city
I'll make it through, follow me
Follow me, set me free
Trust me and we will escape from the city
I'll make it through; prove it to you
Follow me!
Follow me!

[Outro]
I'll make it through
Oh yeah!
